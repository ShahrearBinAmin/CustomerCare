Limitations:
------------
1.This project was only for my academic 2nd year 1st semester project, there was not much time to fix all the bugs
2.You can'nt use 'Bank Refill' & 'Contact us' by opening this project only one. You can use one of them. If you want to use another feature then
  you must restart this software. It's due to limitation of my knowledge about networking.
3. "java_db.sql" && "adminupdate.sql" file must be imported to the wampserver (other two are not necessary).
4.sql file name should be "java_db.sql" && "adminupdate.sql" instead of "java_db(2).sql" && "adminupdate(2).sql" if get any error.
5.You must have some data in your sql file
